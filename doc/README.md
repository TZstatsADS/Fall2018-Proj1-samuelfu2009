# ADS Project 1: What made you happy today?
### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It can have subfolders.  

Please Run Text_Processing.rmd file prior running the Project1_SF.rmd

PLease note: As it for now, the Rmd file contains topic modeling analysis while as the html doesn't due to technical issue. I will delete this note once I have this problem fixed. It may take 20 mins to run the rmd file if you are interested in the topic modeling analysis part.
