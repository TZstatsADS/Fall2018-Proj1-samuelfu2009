### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2018

+ Projec title: Happy Moments - a Study Tageting at People in Their 20s and 30s
+ This project is conducted by [Sen Fu sf2873]

+ Project summary: 
In this project, we analyzed what are people's happy moments by employing three types of methods including simple sentences analysis, sentiment anlaysis and topic modeling. Specifically, we looked into the cohort of people in their 20s and 30s since we are in our 20s and we are interested in what makes our contempoararies happy and what it will be like in the next 10 years or so when we are in our 30s. Our finding is that young folks are more "selfish" by which I mean their happy moments are more focusing on leisure entertainment. Comparing with young folks, mature cohort (people in their 30s) are more family oriented. In addition, we also find out by sentiment analysis that for the same "happy" key words, people have different feelings towards them. Lastly, by topic modeling analysis, we find the ten most frequent words among all sample which are "found", "day", "time", "morning", "feel", "dinner", "friend","watched" "finally", and "walk".
